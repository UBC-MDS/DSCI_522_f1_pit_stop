### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure that the project owner agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal

### Pull request process

*  I recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
